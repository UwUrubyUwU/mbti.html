    <p>INTJ sees the world as a chessboard, so every step he takes is a perfect goal for him according to his own strategy.

INTJ-A, the assertive INTJ personality, is characterized by difficulty entering into personal relationships, because he does not like commitment. Unlike the troubled engineer, we can say that he is better at dealing and getting along with his passion partner.</p>
